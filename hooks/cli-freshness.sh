# SessionStart hook: report a PATH wrapper left behind by a plugin update.
#
# `install-cli` writes the wrapper with the plugin path it was generated from
# baked in, and plugin directories are version-pinned, so an update leaves the
# wrapper running the previous build. Nothing else notices: the slash command
# and the skills resolve CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT and stay current, while a plain
# shell keeps the stale CLI. Comparing the two versions once per session catches
# it for every consumer rather than only for whoever invokes a skill that checks.
#
# Never blocks, and stays silent when the CLI is not on PATH: the plugin works
# without the wrapper, so its absence is not drift.

msg="PLEASE TELL THE USER (do not skip): the $NAME CLI on PATH reports version $wrapper_ver, but the installed $NAME plugin is $plugin_ver. The wrapper was written by a past install and points at where the plugin lived then, so a plain shell runs the old build. Run $REFRESH_COMMAND to refresh it, or \`git pull\` in the local source checkout if the wrapper points there. Running the bootstrap from a shell will not fix it: the stale wrapper re-installs itself from the version it already names. Skills and slash commands are unaffected."
